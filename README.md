## Requirements

To run this, you need to have the CoffeeCup CLI installed. Get it from here: https://github.com/fischeversenker/coffeecup-cli.
You need to be logged in using the CLI and you can only use tasks from projects for which you have set up an alias using `coffeecup projects alias`. See the CoffeeCup CLI repository for more details.
